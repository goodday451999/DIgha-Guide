<h2><font size="10" face="Forte" color="red"><u>PLACE OF INTEREST</u></font></h2>
<p><font size="10"><strong>Digha's old beach is not as wide as it used to be due to heavy soil erosion. Big stones and concrete steps are used to hold together the beach. Another problem is the record number of tidal waves that have caused many of the unplanned shacks and smaller hotels to succumb to the sea. Since it is one of very few popular beaches in West Bengal, it gets overcrowded, especially during the cooler winter break.
A new beach has been developed "New Digha" which is about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the old beach. This new beach is not only bigger than the old one, but might be considered a better one.[citation needed] It is clean and well-maintained and is not surrounded by a congested locality like the older beach. The latest attraction of New Digha is the Science Centre established by the National Council of Science Museums. The entire stretch of the Digha seaface from Old Digha to New Digha is filled with casuarina plantations, which looks beautiful.</strong></font></p></td></tr>
